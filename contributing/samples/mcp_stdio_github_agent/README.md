# GitHub MCP Agent

This is an agent that uses the GitHub MCP tool to call GitHubâ€™s API. It demonstrates how to pass in your Personal Access Token and interact with repositories, issues, and pull requests.

Follow the instructions below to use it:

* Follow the installation instructions in the GitHub MCP Server README to set up and run the server via Docker:  
  https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server

* Set the environment variable `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` to the token you obtained in the previous step:
  ```bash
  export GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your_personal_access_token>
  ```

* Run the agent in the ADK Web UI or via CLI:
  ```bash
  python agent.py
  ```


* Sample queries using GitHub MCP capabilities:

  - `List all my repositories for the authenticated user`  
  - `Search for issues in "octocat/Hello-World" with state "open"`  
  - `Get the contents of "src/" in repo "your-org/your-repo"`  
  - `Create a new issue in "your-org/your-repo" titled "MCP integration" with body "Please review the setup."`  
  - `Add a comment to issue #42 in "your-org/your-repo": "Looks good to me!"`  
  - `List pull requests in "your-org/your-repo" sorted by "created"`  
  - `Get code scanning alerts for "your-org/your-repo"`  
  - `Search code in "your-org/your-repo" for query "def initialize"`
