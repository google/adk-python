# Context

## Architecture

The runtime uses two scoping objects:

-   **InvocationContext** — singleton per invocation. Holds shared state
    (session, services, event queue) accessible by all nodes. Pydantic model at
    `agents/invocation_context.py`.
-   **Context** — one per node execution. Holds per-node results (output, route,
    interrupt_ids) and provides the API surface for node code. At
    `agents/context.py`.

Every Context holds a reference to the same InvocationContext
(`_invocation_context`). Service access (artifacts, memory, auth) is delegated
through it.

```
Root Context                      ← created by Runner from IC
└── Context [runner.node]         ← the root node (e.g., Workflow)
    ├── Context [child_a]         ← child node A
    └── Context [child_b]         ← child node B
        └── Context [grandchild]  ← nested child
```

The Runner creates `root_ctx = Context(ic)` as the tree root and passes it as
`parent_ctx` to `NodeRunner(node=self.node)`. The root Context has no node_path
or run_id — it exists solely as the parent for the Runner's root node. All
Contexts in the tree share the same InvocationContext singleton.

InvocationContext contents:

-   `session`, `agent`, `user_content`
-   `invocation_id`, `app_name`, `user_id`
-   Services: `artifact_service`, `memory_service`, `credential_service`
-   `run_config`, `live_request_queue`
-   `process_queue` — shared event queue consumed by the main loop

## 1:1 node-context mapping

Every node execution gets its own Context instance. The relationship is strictly
1:1: one node, one Context. The Context tree mirrors the node execution tree.

**NodeRunner** creates the child Context from the parent's Context via
`_create_child_context()`. The child inherits:

-   `_invocation_context` — same singleton (shared session, services)
-   `node_path` — parent path + node name (e.g., `wf/child_a`)
-   `run_id` — unique per execution (reused on resume)
-   `event_author` — inherited from parent
-   `schedule_dynamic_node_internal` — inherited from parent

The child does NOT inherit output, route, or interrupt_ids — those are
per-execution results, starting fresh (unless resume carries forward
`prior_output` / `prior_interrupt_ids`).

## Node result properties

These properties on Context are the primary mechanism for communicating results
between nodes:

-   **`ctx.output`** — the node's result value. Set once per execution. Can be
    set via `yield value` (framework sets it) or `ctx.output = X` directly.
    Second write raises `ValueError`.
-   **`ctx.route`** — routing value for conditional edges. Set independently of
    output. Workflow-specific.
-   **`ctx.interrupt_ids`** — accumulated interrupt IDs. Read-only for user
    code. Set by framework when node yields an Event with
    `long_running_tool_ids`.

Output and interrupts can coexist — the orchestrator's `_finalize` decides what
to propagate. The orchestrator reads these properties after the child node
finishes.

## Class hierarchy

```
ReadonlyContext          (agents/readonly_context.py)
  └── Context            (agents/context.py)
```

**ReadonlyContext** — read-only view used in callbacks and plugins:

-   `user_content`, `invocation_id`, `agent_name`
-   `state` (returns `MappingProxyType` — immutable view)
-   `session`, `user_id`, `run_config`

**Context(ReadonlyContext)** — full read-write context for node execution.
Extends ReadonlyContext with mutable state, node results, workflow metadata, and
service methods. See property reference below.
